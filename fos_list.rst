Free and Open-Source Repositories and Models
============================================

A laundary list of other QSD-relevant FOS resources, some repositories/models may appear in more than one list, but better to repeat than miss :).


Process Simulation
------------------
Water/wastewater/sanitation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. Water/astewater treatment models (requires MATLAB) established/compiled by the `PROSYS center at the Technical University of Denmark <https://www.kt.dtu.dk/english/research/prosys>`_ and the `IEA division at the Lund University <https://iea.lth.se/>`_, including (check the the repository for the most-up-to-date list of models):

	#. `Activated sludge models <https://github.com/wwtmodels/Activated-Sludge-Models>`_
	#. `Anaerobic digestion models <https://github.com/wwtmodels/Anaerobic-Digestion-Models>`_
	#. `Benchmark simulation models <https://github.com/wwtmodels/Anaerobic-Digestion-Models>`_
	#. `Biofilm models <https://github.com/wwtmodels/Biofilm-Models>`_
	#. `WWTP influent generators <https://github.com/wwtmodels/Influent-Generator-Models>`_
	#. `Plant-wide models <https://github.com/wwtmodels/Plant-Wide-Models>`_
	#. `System-wide models <https://github.com/wwtmodels/System-Wide-Models>`_
	
#. Eawag `aerobic granular sludge model <https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/eng/projects/abwasser/ags-aerobic-granular-slugde-model/>`_ (requires SUMO, includes R scripts for analysis/plotting and Python script for repetitive SUMO runs).
#. Eawag `Technology Appropriateness Assessment (TechAppA) model <https://github.com/Eawag-SWW/TechAppA>`_ for the quantification of the appropriateness of technologies (techs) in a given context (case) considering uncertainties
#. Eawag `SWMM-HEAT model <https://github.com/Eawag-SWW/EAWAG-SWMM-HEAT>`_ for simulation of heat- and hydraulic processes in sewers.


Energy/Chemical Engineering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. `IDAES Process Systems Engineering Framework <https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse>`_
#. `Waste-to-Energy System Simulation (WESyS) Model <https://github.com/NREL/WESyS-Model>`_


Other Curated Lists
-------------------
#. `Industrial Ecology Dashborad <https://github.com/IndEcol/Dashboard>`_, the Dashboard includes some life cycle assessment (LCA) repositories, but some more LCA-focused ones:
	#. `calculator <https://github.com/romainsacchi/carculator>`_ for prospective environmental and economic life cycle assessment of vehicles
	#. Notes for a `Brightway2 <https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2>`_ (framework for advanced life cycle assessment calculations) `seminar <https://github.com/PoutineAndRosti/Brightway-Seminar-2017>`_
#. `Open Sustainable Technology <https://github.com/protontypes/open-sustainable-technology>`_
#. `Awesome Python Data Science <https://github.com/thomasjpfan/awesome-python-data-science>`_
